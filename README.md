Dependency Injection in ASP.NET Core
====================================

Introduction
------------

Dependency injection (DI) is a software design pattern that allows us to achieve Inversion of Control (IoC) between classes and their dependencies. It means that instead of creating and managing the dependencies ourselves, we let the framework handle them for us. This way, we can focus on the business logic of our classes and make them more loosely coupled, testable, and maintainable.

ASP.NET Core supports dependency injection out of the box, and provides a built-in service container that we can use to register and resolve our services. A service is any class or interface that provides some functionality to the application, such as data access, logging, caching, etc.

In this README file, we will explain how to use dependency injection in ASP.NET Core, and how to choose the appropriate service lifetime for our services.

Service Registration
--------------------

To use dependency injection in ASP.NET Core, we need to register our services with the service container. The service container is an instance of the `IServiceProvider` interface that is available throughout the application. We can access it through the `RequestServices` property of the `HttpContext` object, or through constructor injection in our classes.

The service registration is typically done in the `ConfigureServices` method of the `Program` class, using the `WebApplicationBuilder` parameter. The `WebApplicationBuilder` is a builder object that allows us to configure various aspects of our web application, such as logging, configuration, hosting, etc. One of its properties is `Services`, which is an `IServiceCollection` object that we can use to add our services to the collection. We can use various extension methods to add our services to the collection, such as `AddTransient`, `AddScoped`, `AddSingleton`, etc.

The extension methods take either a service type and an implementation type, or a service type and a factory function as parameters. For example:

```
// Register a service type and an implementation type
builder.Services.AddTransient<IMyService, MyService>();

// Register a service type and a factory function
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IMyService>(provider => new MyService(provider.GetRequiredService<ILogger>()));

```

The extension methods also return the `IServiceCollection` object, so we can chain multiple calls together. For example:

```
builder.Services.AddTransient<IMyService1, MyService1>()
               .AddScoped<IMyService2, MyService2>()
               .AddSingleton<IMyService3, MySingletonService>();

```

Service Resolution
------------------

Once we have registered our services with the service container, we can resolve them in our classes using constructor injection. Constructor injection is the preferred way of injecting dependencies in ASP.NET Core, as it makes the dependencies explicit and avoids using the service locator pattern.

To use constructor injection, we simply declare a parameter of the service type in the constructor of our class, and assign it to a private field. For example:

```
public class MyController : Controller
{
    private readonly IMyService _myService;

    public MyController(IMyService myService)
    {
        _myService = myService;
    }

    public IActionResult Index()
    {
        var result = _myService.DoSomething();
        return View(result);
    }
}

```

The framework will automatically create an instance of the service and pass it to the constructor when it activates our class. We can then use the private field to access the service throughout our class.

We can also inject multiple services in the same constructor, as long as they are registered with the service container. For example:

```
public class MyController : Controller
{
    private readonly IMyService1 _myService1;
    private readonly IMyService2 _myService2;

    public MyController(IMyService1 myService1, IMyService2 myService2)
    {
        _myService1 = myService1;
        _myService2 = myService2;
    }

    // ...
}

```

Service Lifetimes
-----------------

When we register our services with the service container, we need to specify their lifetimes. The lifetime determines how long an instance of the service is reused before it is disposed or garbage collected. Choosing the right lifetime for our services is important for performance and correctness reasons.

There are three lifetimes available with the Microsoft Dependency Injection container: transient, scoped, and singleton.

### Transient

Transient services are created every time they are requested from the service container. This means that each class that depends on a transient service will get a new instance of that service. Transient services are suitable for lightweight and stateless services that do not have any dependencies on other services.

For example, we can register a transient service like this:

```
builder.Services.AddTransient<IMyTransientService, MyTransientService>();

```

### Scoped

Scoped services are created once per request scope. This means that each request will get its own instance of the service, but within the same request, multiple classes that depend on a scoped service will get the same instance of that service. Scoped services are suitable for services that need to maintain some state per request, or that have dependencies on other scoped services.

For example, we can register a scoped service like this:

```
builder.Services.AddScoped<IMyScopedService, MyScopedService>();

```

### Singleton

Singleton services are created once for the entire application lifetime. This means that the same instance of the service will be used by all the classes that depend on it, regardless of the request. Singleton services are suitable for services that need to share some state across the application, or that have dependencies on other singleton services.

For example, we can register a singleton service like this:

```
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IMySingletonService, MySingletonService>();

```

Conclusion
----------

In this README file, we have explained how to use dependency injection in ASP.NET Core, and how to choose the appropriate service lifetime for our services. Dependency injection is a powerful technique that helps us write more modular, testable, and maintainable code. We hope that this file has been helpful for you and your project.
